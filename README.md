### Setup

The project will run without any setup. Open index.html to see the result.

Because no dead code elimination was used extra tailwindcss classes can be added to the index.html without rebuilding anything. Custom css can always be added, either in the html file itself, or in a new css file with a corresponding link tag in the html file.

To add custom properties to the tailwind.config.js file first run `npm install`

After this modifications can be made to the config file. Run `npm run build` to rebuild the css file.

## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)

### What I learned

While I already had some experience with Tailwindcss it was nice getting some more experience with it.

This was the first time I used an SVG as a background so it took a few tries to get that correct (and I also nearly forgot to implement it).

As a bit more abstract point I worked on actually finishing a project with this. Normally my projects quickly grow in scope, or I get bored of them and quit. With this one I wanted to focus on getting it done and submitted

### Continued development

After this I would like to practice writing just CSS without any frameworks to help. Using Tailwindcss was really nice, but I think if I keep focusing on that without fully understanding the basics of CSS I might run into problems down the line.

After that I would like to learn more about design itself. I hope to achieve some of this by making more projects, and learning from what others have designed. At some point I would like to be able to completely create my own designs and fully implement them.
