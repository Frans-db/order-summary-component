## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)

### What I learned

While I already had some experience with Tailwindcss it was nice getting some more experience with it.

This was the first time I used an SVG as a background so it took a few tries to get that correct (and I also nearly forgot to implement it).

As a bit more abstract point I worked on actually finishing a project with this. Normally my projects quickly grow in scope, or I get bored of them and quit. With this one I wanted to focus on getting it done and submitted

### Continued development

After this I would like to practice writing just CSS without any frameworks to help. Using Tailwindcss was really nice, but I think if I keep focusing on that without fully understanding the basics of CSS I might run into problems down the line.

After that I would like to learn more about design itself. I hope to achieve some of this by making more projects, and learning from what others have designed. At some point I would like to be able to completely create my own designs and fully implement them.
